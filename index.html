     <ul id="main">
       <li>
     <h3>Society</h3>
         <p>Traditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. Family values are important in the Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in Nepal. Majority of Nepalis, with or without their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low</p>
         </li>
       <li>
     <h3>Symbols</h3>
     <p>The emblem of Nepal depicts the snowy Himalayas, the forested hills, and the fertile Terai, supported by a wreath of rhododendrons, with the national flag at the crest and in the foreground, a plain white map of Nepal below it, and a man's and woman's right hands joined to signify gender equality. At the bottom is the national motto, a Sanskrit quote of patriotism attributed in Nepali folklore to Lord Rama, written in Devanagari script—"Mother and motherland are greater than heaven".</p>
         </li>
       <li>
     <h3>Art and architecture</h3>
     <p>The oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are stupas of early Buddhist constructions in and around Kapilvastu in south-western Nepal, and those constructed by Ashoka in the Kathmandu Valley c. 250 BC. </p>
         </li>
       <li>
     <h3>Cuisine</h3>
     <p>Nepali cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines. The foundation of a typical Nepali meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion, and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[313] The latter includes lentils, pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic, but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon, jimbu and others as informed by culinary conventions.</p>
